    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I am college student who is 19 years old. My birthday is May 11, which makes my birthday not very fun because of finals. I am okay at coding, but I procrastinate a lot. I am very tired and sick while doing this assigment.</p>
    <p>I work two jobs. I work at panera bread, and the tutoring center at Lake Land College. I sometiems tutor people in coding, but its mostly in cengage. Cengage is my mortal enemy. Try tutoring someone on Cengage over zoom. It is not fun.</p>

        <h3>Story one</h3>
        <P>This story is a romance story. It is set in a high fantasy setting, akin to standard dungeon and dragons settings. A botinist is searching for a rare and endagered plant, and meets someone who is growing and caring for it perfectly. They fall in love.</P>

        <h3>Story two</h3>
        <p>I dreamt this last night while running a fever so it is in early development. It is a modern setting story with magic included. A girl who is in jueive for reasons I have yet to decide desicovers she has magical abilities. It's extremely rare for people to have these, so she has to be sent to a magic school that's super fancy. It's a narrative of disadvantaged person vs rich people and overcoming adversity.</p>
